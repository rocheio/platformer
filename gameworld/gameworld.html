    <h1>Evolving Gameworld</h1>
    <div id="canvas-div"></div>
    <p>I'm learning how to design browser-based games from the ground up. For added motivation, I decided to build everything here in public. What you see is the game so far.

    You can follow my development <a href="https://github.com/rocheio/rocheio.github.io" target="_blank">on Github.</a></p>
    <h2>Basic Controls:</h2>
    <p>Move with the arrow keys. Jump with the space bar. Run with the 'r' key.<br>
    That's all for now. Come back next week to see what's new!</p>
