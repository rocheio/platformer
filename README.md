#### A simple demo of a JavaScript platforming game. Find it at http://roche.io/platformer/

The result of my adventures in game design during October/November 2015. I started with a [guide from William Malone](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/) on how to animate a character, applied some physics, a control scheme, and some levels, and ended up with what can technically be called a game.

I learned a lot from the experience, but will probably not pursue it further. While it's one of the more fun technical challenges I've had, I feel that building data-driven apps is a better niche for a solo developer than game design.
